        <h3>Dragging Passages</h3>
        <p>
            You may use one finger to drag passages around when organizing your project.

        <h3>Scrolling</h3>
        <p>
            As you add passages to your story, you will need to scroll around your work space.
            You may do this by touching the screen with two fingers then drag them towards the
            direction you want to scroll.

        </p>
        <h3>Zooming</h3>
        <p>
            When your project becomes bigger and bigger, you may need to zoom out to get a
            better overview look of you passages. You may do this by touching the screen with
            two fingers and moving them apart. The opposite zooms in on the workspace.
